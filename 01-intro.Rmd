Introduction  
Personal development in R, Statisics, Scientific Report, Markdown, and GitHub

About me
In 1999 I finished my Master in Computing Science education at Gothenburg University. In spring 2000 I moved to Jönköping and started to work as an embedded programmer at Saab Avionics. 
During the autumn that year I became a member of the local union. In 2001 I attended my first wage negotiation for The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers at Saab Avionics. 
Since then I have been interested in the wage formation for engineers in Sweden and the Jönköping county.
In 2019 I am still employed at Saab Avionics, the chairman at The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers at Saab Avionics, the chairman at The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers at the Jönköpiong county and
a member of Jönköpingslistan, The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers council.c
