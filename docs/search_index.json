Introduction Personal development in R, Statisics, Scientific Report, Markdown, and GitHub with data from Statistics Sweden. I will extract statistics from Statistics Sweden regarding the labour market, salaries and other relevant data from engineers, primarily in Jönköping county. About me In 1999 I finished my Master in Computing Science education at Gothenburg University. In spring 2000 I moved to Jönköping and started to work as an embedded programmer at Saab Avionics. During the autumn that year I became a member of the local union. In 2001 I attended my first wage negotiation for The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers at Saab Avionics. Since then I have been interested in the wage formation for engineers in Sweden and the Jönköping county. In 2019 I am still employed at Saab Avionics, the chairman at The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers at Saab Avionics, the chairman at The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers at the Jönköpiong county and a member of Jönköpingslistan, The Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers council.c Wage statistics The Mediation Institute is responsible for Sweden’s official salary statistics. This applies to three types of statistics: cyclical wage statistics, wage structure statistics and statistics supplied to the European statistical body Eurostat. The statistics are collected and processed by Statistics Sweden. It is reported both on Statistics Sweden’s website and here on the Mediation Institute’s website. Economic Wage statistics The cyclical wage statistics show wage developments month by month. It is the most up-to-date salary statistics since it is published two months after the survey. It is then revised when new information arrives and can be regarded as definitive one year after the measurement. Structure of Earnings Once a year, the salary structure statistics provide an overview and comparable statistics on the salary structure for the entire labour market. The salary structure statistics give a picture of the wage situation in the various sectors of society, but also show the wages of 429 professions or professional groups. The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise produces wage statistics on behalf of the member organizations. The wage statistics are used in negotiations with trade unions, in advising the companies and in the companies’ analysis work. The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and Industry co-operates with Statistics Sweden, which is responsible for the official wage statistics in Sweden. The collaboration means that member companies do not have to report wage statistics to both Statistics Sweden and The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise. This minimizes corporate work. SSYK (Standard for Swedish Occupational Classification) is a system for classifying individuals’ occupation and work. It is based on the international professional standard ISCO-08 (International Standard Classification of Occupations) used in reporting and compiling statistics within the EU. SSYK is based on two main concepts, the type of work performed and the qualifications required. Qualifications mean the knowledge and skills required to perform the tasks that belong to a given job. It should be pointed out that it is the qualifications that the work in question requires that matter, not the qualifications that the worker possesses that constitute the work. The knowledge and skills required for the job may as well have been acquired through work experience as well as through formal education. If the degree of difficulty or orientation of the tasks varies, the worker shall be classified in the area in which the worker mainly works. Occupation area 2 - The professions with requirements for in-depth higher education The field of work includes: · developing theories, models and methods and designing their practical applications in physics, chemistry, mathematics, statistics, engineering, pharmacology, environment, agriculture and forestry, medicine, economics, finance, marketing and informatics, law, social sciences and humanities · draw buildings etc. and lead construction and civil engineering projects · plan and control extraction and manufacturing processes · design and develop products · verify compliance with health and environmental protection regulations · investigate and treat patients · teach and develop teaching methodology · organize activities at museums, libraries etc. and within care and social services · do financial investigations, plan and investigate the activities of companies and organizations · handle cases and prepare reports · analyze, design, develop, test, manage and manage IT systems · make reports, write articles or literary works, produce radio and television programs · create works of art, compose, interpret or make music, drama and dance · lead and plan assembly work. The occupation area comprises the following main groups: 21 Professions with requirements for advanced university competence in science and technology 22 Professions with requirements for advanced university competence in health care 23 Professions with requirements for advanced university competence in education 24 Profession with requirements for advanced proficiency in advanced education 25 Professions with requirements for in-depth higher education in IT 26 Professions with requirements for in-depth higher education in law, culture and social work, etc. 2141 The MSc in Logistics and Production Planning Develops, manages, plans and controls material and information flows and production planning.
