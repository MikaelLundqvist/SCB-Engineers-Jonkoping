In my last post, I found that experience has a significant impact on the salary of engineers. Is the significance of experience on wages unique to engineers or are there similar correlations in other occupational groups?

I will use the same model in principal as in my previous post to calculate the significance of age. I will not use sex as an explanatory variable since there are occupational groups that do not have enough data for both genders. I will also use a polynomial of degree three since this provides a significant model fit for some occupational groups.

There are still occupational groups with too little data for regression analysis. More than 30 posts are necessary to fit both age and year.

The R-value from the Anova table is used as the single value to discriminate how much the age and salary correlates. For exploratory analysis, the Anova value seems good enough.

In the figure below I will also use the estimate for the year to see how much the salaries are raised each year for the different occupational groups holding age as constant.

```{r , echo = TRUE}
library (tidyverse)
library (broom)
library (car)
library (polynom)

readfile <- function (file1){read_csv (file1, col_types = cols(), locale = readr::locale (encoding = "latin1"), na = c("..", "NA")) %>%
  gather (starts_with("19"), starts_with("20"), key = "year", value = salary) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate (year_n = parse_number (year))
}
```

The data table is downloaded from Statistics Sweden. It is saved as a comma-delimited file without heading, 000000D2.csv, http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/.

The table: Average basic salary, monthly salary and women´s salary as a percentage of men´s salary by sector, occupational group (SSYK 2012), sex and age. Year 2014 - 2018 Monthly salary All sectors

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'The significance of experience on the salary in Sweden, a comparison between different occupational groups, Year 2014 - 2018'} 
tb <- readfile("000000D2.csv") %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(age_l = unlist(lapply(strsplit(substr(age, 1, 5), "-"), strtoi))[1]) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(age_h = unlist(lapply(strsplit(substr(age, 1, 5), "-"), strtoi))[2]) %>%
  mutate(age_n = (age_l + age_h) / 2)

summary_table = 0
anova_table = 0

for (i in unique(tb$`occuptional  (SSYK 2012)`)){
  temp <- filter(tb, `occuptional  (SSYK 2012)` == i)
  if (dim(temp)[1] > 30){
    model <-lm (log(salary) ~ year_n + poly(age_n, 3), data = temp)
    summary_table <- rbind (summary_table, mutate (tidy (summary (model)), ssyk = i))
    anova_table <- rbind (anova_table, mutate (tidy (Anova (model, type = 2)), ssyk = i))
  }
}

merge(summary_table, anova_table, by = "ssyk", all = TRUE) %>%
  filter (term.y == "poly(age_n, 3)") %>%
  filter (term.x == "year_n") %>%
  ggplot () +
    geom_point (mapping = aes(x = estimate, y = statistic.y)) +
    labs(
      x = "Increase in salaries (% / year)",
      y = "F-value for age"
    ) 
```

The table with all occupational groups sorted by F-value in descending order.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
merge(summary_table, anova_table, by = "ssyk", all = TRUE) %>%
  filter (term.y == "poly(age_n, 3)") %>%
  filter (term.x == "year_n") %>%
  select (ssyk, estimate, statistic.y) %>%
  rename (`F-value for age` = statistic.y) %>%
  rename (`Increase in salary` = estimate) %>%
  arrange (desc (`F-value for age`)) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    booktabs = TRUE,
    caption = 'Correlation for F-value (age) and the yearly increase in salaries with age held as constant')
```

Let's check what we have found.
