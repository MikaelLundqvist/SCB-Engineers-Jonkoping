# Appendix A

Theoretical study of salaries in groups with different age / salary structures.  
Suppose there is two groups A and B that both have flat age distributions.   
Group B have a flat salary distribution in general, in group A the oldest   
employees earns twice as much as the youngest in general.    
    
```{r AppendixA1, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Salary structure of Group A and Group B'}  	
A <- seq(30000, 60000, by=750)  
B <- seq(30000, 30000, length=41)  
year <- 2019  
by <- (year - 25):(year - 65)    
tibble(by, A, B) %>%   
  gather(A, B, key = "group", value = "salary") %>%  
  ggplot() +  
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = by, y = salary, fill = group), stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +  
  labs(  
    title = "Salary structure of Group A and Group B"  
  )  
```
  
During the year both group A and B increase the sum of all salaries for   
respective group by two percent.  
   
```{r AppendixA2, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Salary raise by 2.0%'}    
tibble(A_raise = sum(A) * 0.02, B_raise = sum(B) * 0.02) %>%   
  gather(A_raise, B_raise, key="group", value="raise") %>%  
  ggplot() +  
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=group, y=raise, fill = group), stat = "identity") +  
	labs(  
      title = "Salary raise by 2.0%"  
    )    
```  
  
Suppose that each groups increase is divided equally to the employees within   
respective group.  
	
```{r AppendixA3, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Salary increase distribution over age Group A'} 	
raise <- (A + sum(A) * 0.02 / length (A)) - A	  
g <- tibble(by, A, raise) %>%   
  gather(A, raise, key = "group", value = "salary")  
g$group <-  factor(g$group, levels = c("raise", "A"))  
g %>%  
  ggplot() +  
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = by, y = salary, fill = group), stat = "identity") +  
  labs(  
    title = "Salary increase distribution over age Group A"  
  )		  
```
	   
Suppose that each groups increase is divided equally to the employees within   
respective group.  
	  
```{r AppendixA4, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Salary increase distribution over age Group A'} 	  
raise <- (B + sum(B) * 0.02 / length (B)) - B	  
g <- as_tibble(cbind(by, B, raise)) %>%   
  gather(B, raise, key = "group", value = "salary")  
g$group <-  factor(g$group, levels = c("raise", "B"))  
g %>%  
  ggplot() +  
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = by, y = salary, fill = group), stat = "identity") +  
  labs(  
    title = "Salary increase distribution over age Group B"  
  )  
```
    
The oldest employees retire and new adolescents enter the job market. Suppose   
that the starting salary for respective group is determined by the   
age / salary structure.    
    
```{r AppendixA5, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Salary distribution Group B after one year succession'} 	
by_year2 <- by + 1  
B_year2 <- lag(B)  
B_year2[1] <- B[1] * 1.02  
raise_year2 <- lag(B + sum(B) * 0.02 / length (B) - B)  
raise_year2[1] <- 0  
t <- tibble(by_year2, B_year2, raise_year2) %>%  
  gather(B_year2, raise_year2, key = "group", value = "salary")  
t$group <- factor(t$group, levels=c("raise_year2", "B_year2"))  
t %>%  
  ggplot() +  
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = by_year2, y = salary, fill = group), stat = "identity") +  
  labs(  
    title = "Salary distribution Group B after one year succession"  
  )	   
```  
  
The oldest employees retire and new adolescents enter the job market. Suppose   
that the starting salary for respective group is determined by the   
age / salary structure.      
    
```{r AppendixA6, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Salary distribution Group A after one year succession'} 	
by_year2 <- by + 1  
raise_year2 <- lag(A + sum(A) * 0.02 / length (A) - A)  
raise_year2[1] <- 0  
A_year2 <- lag(A)  
A_year2[1] <- A[1] + raise_year2[2] - (A[2] - A[1])  
t <- tibble(by_year2, A_year2, raise_year2) %>%  
  gather(A_year2, raise_year2, key = "group", value = "salary")  
t$group <- factor(t$group, levels = c("raise_year2", "A_year2"))  
t %>%  
  ggplot() +  
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = by_year2, y = salary, fill = group), stat = "identity") +  
  labs(  
    title = "Salary distribution Group A after one year succession"  
  )	   
```  
  
Before next years salary revision the sum of the salaries have increased by   
2.0 % for group B and only 0.31% for group A  
    
```{r AppendixA7, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Salary raise since last revision'} 
tibble(A_raise_sum = sum(A) * 0.02 - A[length(A)] + A_year2[1], B_raise_sum = sum(B) * 0.02) %>%   
  gather(A_raise_sum, B_raise_sum, key = "group", value = "raise") %>%  
  ggplot() +  
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=group, y=raise, fill = group), stat = "identity") +  
	labs(  
      title = "Salary raise since last revision"  
    )     
```	
	
This animation shows how the salary development progresses for a longer   
period of time according to the prerequicites stated above.  
 
```{r AppendixA8, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Salary development different groups.'}  
A <- seq(30000, 60000, by = 750)  
B <- seq(30000, 30000, length = 41)  
for (year in 2019:2059){  
 by <- (year - 25):(year - 65)    
 tibble(by, A, B) %>%   
   gather(A, B, key = "group", value = "salary") %>%  
   ggplot() +  
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = by, y = salary, colour = group)) +  
     labs(  
       title = "Salary development different groups.",  
		subtitle = paste ("Year of revision", year)  
     ) +  
	  scale_x_continuous(name = "Year of birth", limits = c(1954, 2034)) +  
     scale_y_continuous(name = "Salary", limits = c(30000, 80000))		    
 ggsave(paste (year, sep="", ".png"))  
 A <- A + sum (A) * 0.020 / length (A)  
 A <- c(A[1] - 750, A[1:40])  
 B <- B * 1.02  
}
